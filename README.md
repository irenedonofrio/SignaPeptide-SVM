# SignaPeptide-SVM

This repository contains all the materials for the final project of the course Laboratory of Bioinformatics 2 of the MSc Bioinformatics - University of Bologna (AY 2023-2024). 
The projects consists in implementing two different methods for the **identification of signal peptides in eukaryotes**: 
* A position-specific weight matrix (**PSWM**) method, that traces one of the earliest approaches (von Heijne, 1986);
* A Support Vector Machine classifier (**SVC**)
